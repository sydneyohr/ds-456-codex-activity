# Macalester DS 456 - Projects in Data Science - Codex Activity

*Shilad Sen (with help from Codex), 2025/11/25*

In this activity you will:

- Use Codex as a collaborator on a real spatial dataset.
- Practice being *critical* of Codex’s suggestions (not just accepting them).
- Compare different prompting styles (one-shot vs. planned) for research questions.

This activity was developed on a Mac in November 2025. It should work on other platforms, but tools change quickly—if something breaks, document it and ask questions!

# 0. Get the project

- Fork the [Codex Activity](https://github.com/shilad/ds-456-codex-activity) on GitHub.
- Clone **your fork** (not the original) to your computer.

# 1. Choose your tools and set up Codex

You may work in **Python (VS Code)** or **R (VS Code or RStudio)**.

## 1.1 Highly Recommended: VS Code + Codex (Python or R)

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install the [Codex VS Code extension](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide/).
- If you are using R, also install the [VS Code R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reditorsupport.r).
- Open your cloned repo folder in VS Code.
- In the Codex sidebar:
  - Click “Use API Key” and use the key Shilad gave you.  
    **DO NOT PUT THIS KEY ANYWHERE IN YOUR GITHUB REPO.**
  - Open Codex settings → “Open `config.toml`” and set it to:
    ```toml
    model = "gpt-5.1"
    model_reasoning_effort = "medium"

    [tools]
    web_search_request = true

    [sandbox_workspace_write]
    network_access = true
    ```
  - Restart VS Code after editing `config.toml`.

## 1.2 Optional: RStudio + Codex in a separate terminal

If you strongly prefer RStudio:

- Use **RStudio** for your R scripts / Rmd files.
- Using a terminal, install the Codex CLI: `npm i -g @openai/codex`
- In a terminal, run `codex` once so it creates a config file at `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Open `~/.codex/config.toml` in any text editor you like (VS Code, TextEdit, Notepad, `nano`, etc.) and paste the same settings shown in 1.1.
- In a separate terminal window (**from the repo root**), run Codex and use it to:
  - Draft and refactor R code.
  - Ask questions about errors.
- You are still responsible for keeping all code and writeups in this repo so they can be graded.

# 2. Create your assignment skeleton

You will **not** edit this `README.md` directly. Instead:

- Copy `README.md` to `Codex_Activity.md`.
- Add your name(s) at the top of `Codex_Activity.md`.
- For every prompt marked **Task:** below, you will write your answers in `Codex_Activity.md`.
- Your actual analysis code should live in code files, for example:
  - R: `analysis/codex_activity.Rmd` or `analysis/codex_activity.R`
  - Python: `analysis/codex_activity.ipynb` or `analysis/codex_activity.py`

You may reference your code files from `Codex_Activity.md` (e.g., “see Figure 1 in `analysis/codex_activity.Rmd`”).


# 3. Early dataset interactions

- Pick a spatial dataset from [Open Data Minneapolis](https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov).  
  One fun option (used in the instructor example) is  
  [Motorized Foot & eBike Trips in 2023](https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/95547087876344e592dbdfa6244bbc43_0/explore).
- Give Codex the URL for the dataset and ask it to help you get started understanding the data.  
  Keep your request intentionally vague (e.g., “Help me explore this dataset”).

**Task 3.1 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**  
What do you notice about this early interaction? Consider:
- What did Codex assume or gloss over?
- Did it make any mistakes or questionable choices?
- How clear or explainable was the code it produced?

# 4. More directed exploration

- If you are partner coding, *switch partners*.
- Download the dataset you would like to analyze and move it under `data/`.
- Ask Codex to help you analyze the **basic information** about the dataset:
  - basic summaries (rows, columns, variable types),
  - simple visualizations,
  - any surprising patterns.
- Then ask Codex for specific improvements (e.g., “Use `dplyr` instead of base R”, “Add labels and titles”, “Handle missing values more carefully”).

**Task 4.1 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- What did Codex do well?
- What would you have done differently if you wrote the code yourself?
- Looking at the code Codex wrote, what could be improved (style, clarity, correctness, efficiency)?

# 5. Mapping the data

- If you are partner coding, *switch partners*.
- Ask Codex to help you map your data. Pay attention to what happens at first:
  - Does it correctly identify what is needed to make a map?
  - Does it confuse attributes (like IDs) with coordinates?
- Try to figure out how to geocode / map the data:
  - See if Codex can find the right approach.
  - See if you can figure it out yourself.
  - Don’t peek at the instructor’s solution scripts unless you are truly stuck.
- For the scooter/e‑bike example, the goal is to join trips to a street or trail network such as the  
  [PW Street Centerline dataset](https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/pw-street-centerline/about) and then map trip counts by segment.

**Task 5.1 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- Describe what was easier and harder about doing this with Codex.
- Where did Codex help, and where did it get in the way?
- What would you do differently next time you had to map a new dataset with AI assistance?

# 6. Identifying a research question with Codex

- If you are partner coding, *switch partners*.
- You will now work with Codex to identify and refine a research question (RQ) about your dataset.

## 6.1 Brainstorm candidate questions

- Seed the brainstorming session with some themes or ideas of research questions that interest you.
- Ask Codex to propose several possible research questions.
- Collaborate with Codex to prioritize the questions along the decision dimensions you think are most appropriate.

**Task 6.1 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- List at least two candidate research questions that Codex suggested.
- For each, briefly note what seems interesting and what might be problematic (data, scope, ethics, feasibility).

## 6.2 Refine and choose your question

- Pick one question (it may be a slight modification of a Codex suggestion).
- Ask Codex to critique and refine that question. For example:
  - “Here is my tentative research question: […]. Critique its clarity and feasibility. Propose 1–2 improved versions.”
- Decide on a **final RQ** you will try to answer. This choice is yours, not Codex’s.

**Task 6.2 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- Write down your final research question in one clear sentence.
- In 2–3 sentences, explain why you chose it (and why you rejected other candidates).

# 7. Answering your question with Codex: one-shot vs. plan-first

- You will now use Codex to help answer your chosen research question in two different ways.

## 7.1 One-shot interaction

- In your R or Python environment, ask Codex for a **one-shot** solution to your chosen RQ. For example:
  - “Here is my research question: […]. Write code to answer it in one shot.”
- Run the code (after checking it!) and see what happens:
  - Does the analysis actually answer your question?
  - Does the code run?
  - Are the results interpretable and relevant?

**Task 7.1 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- Briefly describe what analysis Codex performed and what results you obtained.
- What was good or bad about this one-shot attempt (data used, methods, code quality, clarity)?

## 7.2 Plan-first interaction

- Now ask Codex to **plan first, then code** for the *same* research question. For example:
  - “Here is my research question: […]. Help me design a 3–5 step plan to answer it. Don’t write any code yet.”
- Review the plan and edit it so it feels realistic and meaningful to you.
- Then, *step by step*, ask Codex to write code for each step:
  - “Now write code for step 1 only…”
  - Run and debug it.
  - “Now write code for step 2…”
- You may do this in `analysis/codex_activity.Rmd`, `.R`, `.py`, or a notebook.

**Task 7.2 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- Briefly describe the main steps in your final plan and what you implemented for each.
- How did the planned interaction differ from the one-shot attempt?
- Which approach produced better code, and which felt more controllable?

## 7.3 Final reflection

**Task 7.3 (in `Codex_Activity.md`):**
- When would you choose one-shot prompting vs. plan-first prompting for future projects?
- What norms or habits do you want to adopt for working with tools like Codex in your own data science work?

# 8. What to hand in

By the end of the activity, your repo should include at least:

- `Codex_Activity.md` with answers to all **Task** prompts (3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3).
- At least one analysis file:
  - R: `analysis/codex_activity.Rmd` or `analysis/codex_activity.R`
  - Python: `analysis/codex_activity.ipynb` or `analysis/codex_activity.py`
- Any additional scripts or notebooks you used, committed in a reasonable state.

Before you’re done:

- Use Codex to help you **commit and push** your work to your forked repo.
- Make sure that your API key is **not** anywhere in the repo.
- Share the URL for the repo (including the markdown and script) on the Moodle activity.
